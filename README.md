# Halloween-Store-Website
A website project to practice creating a website from scratch with HTML and to use CSS to make the website look nicer.
The goal of this project was to create a functional website from scratch and to add specific looks and widgets using CSS. 
The focus of the project was the main page. The links and buttons that lead to other pages of the website are functional, but the other pages do not exist yet. 
I was provided with the directory skeleton and a few image files and support file. However, I created the HTML and CSS files myself.
This project was coded for a web development class at Central Washington University.
